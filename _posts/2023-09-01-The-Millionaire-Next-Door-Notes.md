###### Before Notes

小时候试图看`rich dad poor dad` ,但是读了大概十几页就放弃了

- 一来啃生肉一页就有至少30个生词,根本读不下去
- 而且那时候对钱根本没有概念
- 也没有任何动机去学习理财知识

Why 理财?

- 迫于生活的压力试图,上班如吃屎,苦逼打工人永无出头之日
- pick up 一些理财常识
- 试图理财攒个MI SFH 的 down payment
- 过一波简单的二人一狗生活,然后早日退休躺平

阔别纸质书2年,遂在amazon上面下了单,没想到上午下单下午就到了,写这些notes防止看完就忘,把重点记下来

It is much easier to spend other people's money than dollars that are self-generated
